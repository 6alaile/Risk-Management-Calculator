# Forex Risk Management Calculator
The calculator is a tool that helps the user to determine if they can place a trade in the forex market. This is done by calculating the margin (deposit) required to open the position. 

The user selects the account currency, currency pair being traded and leverage on the account, then enters the lot size (volume) of the trade. This will display a margin in the margin box. Changing these values will also change the margin value.

Disclaimer: This is not a final calculation, broker fees such as spread, swap and comission are not factored into the calculation.
